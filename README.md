# ML Major Projects

This repository contains a collection of my major machine learning projects. The goal is to document and share end-to-end implementations of practical ML solutions. As I continue learning and exploring new areas, I’ll be adding more projects here.

## 📁 Current Project

- [`Fraud-Detection`](./Fraud-Detection):  
  A machine learning project focused on detecting fraudulent transactions using various supervised learning techniques.

> Each project will have its own folder with a detailed `README.md` explaining the problem, approach, and results.

## 🗂️ More Coming Soon

I plan to add more major ML projects in the near future. Stay tuned as this repository grows!

## ⚙️ Tech Stack (General)

- Python
- VS Code
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, etc.
- Git & GitHub
